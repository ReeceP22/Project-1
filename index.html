        <h2>What are Life Hacks?</h2>
        <p>
          This website is here to show you and explain what
          <em>"Life Hacks"</em> are and how to use them in your day to day life
          for more efficient results in your day.
          <br />
          <br />
          Life hacks are simple tricks that you can incoporate into your usual
          daily routines, whether it be at work or at home, that make doing
          tasks more simple, efficient and convenient for you. They're useful
          because they can reduce the amount of time taken to do said task, or
          to just reduce the overall stress of the task or your day as a whole.
          <br />
          <br />
          One example of an easy to incorporate life hack would be to make a
          list of meals you would like at the start of the week. Then you don't
          have debate with yourself every night about what to make for dinner.
          It doesn't seem too helpful at first, but once you try it you will be
          making a list every week.
