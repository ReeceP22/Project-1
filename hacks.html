            <h1>5 Useful Life Hacks</h1>
            <h2>Number 1!</h2>
            <p>
                The first life hack on our list is to put old newspaper in the bottom
                of a new bin bag. This one maybe more for the older audience and the
                homeowners, or if you just want to impress your parents or
                grandparents. This is useful because it saves you or your parents
                having to clean the bottom of the garbage bin out when removing the
                bin bag because the newspaper will absorb any juices or liquids that
                tricle down the inside of the bin.

            <h2>Number 2!</h2>
            <p>
                This life hack is for the people that are always losing their keys. If
                you have a dedicated spot or a channel of hooks to hang your keys on
                near the front door of your house it can be a life saver in those
                morning rushes when you're late for work. This way, whenever you come
                home, you can hang your keys up straight away and know where they are
                for when you next leave.
            </p>

            <h2>Number 3!</h2>
            <p>
                The third life hack on our list is for the lazy morning people and the
                constant alarm snoozing. If you are one of these people (I am), then
                try placing your alarm somewhere out of arms reach, preferrably
                somewhere you would have to get out of bed to turn it. This way when
                you turn your alarm off you'll already be up and out of bed, reducing
                the chances of you just snoozing your alarm and going back to sleep
                only for your alarm to ring again.

            <h2>Number 4!</h2>
            <p>
                This is another simple life hack for the new home owners. Having three
                wash baskets for your lights, darks and coloured clothes to save your
                time seperating them from the same pile ever time you want to put the
                washing on. This is a very easy and time beneficial one because
                sivving through a households clothes and seperating them can be time
                wasting when there's other things to be doing.

            <h2>Number 5!</h2>
            <p>
                Finally, the fifth life hack. <em>This one is for the students</em>.
                When it comes to homework or assignments or even essays, you should
                make your own timetable for the subjects you have chosen. You should
                then organise them by what needs to be handed in first to the last
                that needs to be handed in. Another way to organise your work would be
                to make a list with the easiest tasks at the beginning and the harder
                tasks at the end. This way as you work down your list you will feel
                more productive because you will have crossed more tasks off of your
                list than you may have first expected.

            <h2>A Bonus Life Hack!</h2>
            <p>
                A little bonus hack is another keys related one. If you're someone
                with a lot of similar looking keys you can colour code then however
                you like to differentiate between them easier. The best way to do this
                would be by using nail polish
                <strong>(always ask before using it)</strong>. This is because it will
                not wear off as easy in your pockets like using paint would.
