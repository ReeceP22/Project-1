        <h2>What are Life Hacks?</h2>
        <p>
          This website is here to show you and explain what
          <em>"Life Hacks"</em> are and how to use them in your day to day life
          for more efficient results in your day.
          <br />
          <br />
          Life hacks are simple tricks that you can incoporate into your usual
          daily routines, whether it be at work or at home, that make doing
          tasks more simple, efficient and convenient for you. They're useful
          because they can reduce the amount of time taken to do said task, or
          to just reduce the overall stress of the task or your day as a whole.
          <br />
          <br />
          One example of an easy to incorporate life hack would be to make a
          list of meals you would like at the start of the week. Then you don't
          have debate with yourself every night about what to make for dinner.
          It doesn't seem too helpful at first, but once you try it you will be
          making a list every week.

        <h1>5 Useful Life Hacks</h1>
        <h2>Number 1!</h2>
        <p>
          The first life hack on our list is to put old newspaper in the bottom
          of a new bin bag. This one maybe more for the older audience and the
          homeowners, or if you just want to impress your parents or
          grandparents. This is useful because it saves you or your parents
          having to clean the bottom of the garbage bin out when removing the
          bin bag because the newspaper will absorb any juices or liquids that
          tricle down the inside of the bin.

        <br />
        <h2>Number 2!</h2>
        <p>
          This life hack is for the people that are always losing their keys. If
          you have a dedicated spot or a channel of hooks to hang your keys on
          near the front door of your house it can be a life saver in those
          morning rushes when you're late for work. This way, whenever you come
          home, you can hang your keys up straight away and know where they are
          for when you next leave.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>Number 3!</h2>
        <p>
          The third life hack on our list is for the lazy morning people and the
          constant alarm snoozing. If you are one of these people (I am), then
          try placing your alarm somewhere out of arms reach, preferrably
          somewhere you would have to get out of bed to turn it. This way when
          you turn your alarm off you'll already be up and out of bed, reducing
          the chances of you just snoozing your alarm and going back to sleep
          only for your alarm to ring again.

        <br />
        <h2>Number 4!</h2>
        <p>
          This is another simple life hack for the new home owners. Having three
          wash baskets for your lights, darks and coloured clothes to save your
          time seperating them from the same pile ever time you want to put the
          washing on. This is a very easy and time beneficial one because
          sivving through a households clothes and seperating them can be time
          wasting when there's other things to be doing.

        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Number 5!</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, the fifth life hack. <em>This one is for the students</em>.
          When it comes to homework or assignments or even essays, you should
          make your own timetable for the subjects you have chosen. You should
          then organise them by what needs to be handed in first to the last
          that needs to be handed in. Another way to organise your work would be
          to make a list with the easiest tasks at the beginning and the harder
          tasks at the end. This way as you work down your list you will feel
          more productive because you will have crossed more tasks off of your
          list than you may have first expected.
        </p>

        <h2>A Bonus Life Hack!</h2>
        <p>
          A little bonus hack is another keys related one. If you're someone
          with a lot of similar looking keys you can colour code then however
          you like to differentiate between them easier. The best way to do this
          would be by using nail polish
          <strong>(always ask before using it)</strong>. This is because it will
          not wear off as easy in your pockets like using paint would.
