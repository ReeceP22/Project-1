### User stories

- **As the Author**, I want to create a website where people can come for easy accessible help on what they can add to their day to help make it easier. The user can also rate the life hacks provided and give their own ideas and feedback, via the form on the contact page.
- **As a user**, I want an easy to read and easy to follow webpage of ideas that I can implement into my day.

### Imagery

- All three pages on the site have their own images. These images were downloaded from [Google Images](https://google.com/images) where they were all without a water mark and chosen by preference and relevance to the topic.

## Pages and Features

### General Features

- The Navigation bar across the top of all three pages are linked to their respective names.

- *Home* will take you the the index page.
- *Hacks* will take you to the page containing the life hacks.
- *Contact* will take you to the page with the feedback form where you fill in your email.

- The Footer element contains hyper linked social buttons to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, all labelled appropriately.

### Pages

#### Home Page

- The home page (the index page) outlines the purpose for what the page is, which is a brief explantion as to what life hacks are.

#### Life Hacks Page

- This is the page where all the life hacks are visable and readable.

#### Contact Page

- This is the feedback form page and where the user has to put in their email in order to send off their feedback form.

## Technologies

### HTML and CSS

- Github was used for storing the repository.
- Codeanywhere was used for code editing.

## Accessibility

- To make the site more user friendly and accessible, I added alternative text for all images for the screen reader applications.

- I have made use of semantic HTML elements, such as : *footer*, *section* and *navigation* to make site more organised and each page easy accessible.

## Deplotment

- My Life Hacks site was deployed to Github (https://github.com) pages by following these steps.

1. Go to the Project-1 repository (https://github.com/ReeceP22/Project-1).
2. Click the "settings" tab on the top left to open it.
3. On the left hand side, under "code and automation", click "pages".
4. Underneath "build and deployment" use the dropdown menu to select "deploy from a branch".
5. Under the "branch" section, use the first drop down menu to select "main". Use the second drop down menu to select "/(root)".

## Testing

- Tested on Windows 10, Google Chrome.

- The testing done was via the git command "python3 -m http.server" to give the website a useable browser. I then used the browser to test the resizing and the visuals of the website on 1920x1080p monitor.
- To further the testing, I used the mobile device simulator, found in the devtools console, to test how the site would look on different devices, such as different mobile phones and tablets.

## Credits

### Acknowledgement

- A massive thank you to *Spencer Barriball, my mentor at Code Institute*, for providing me with help and advice on how to better the code I had done and teaching me new ways to use it.

### Code Used

- The Navigation bar was inspired by the teaching and lessons on Code Institute.

- The required field on the email was inspired by various different major websites across all different browsers, as well as the auto complete feature if used on the same browser before.

## Future Improvements

- The future improvements of this website could be to implement interactive icons or buttons to all the pages, possibly to open more images or larger sections of text.
- Another improvement would be to give each page its own, relevant, background image.
